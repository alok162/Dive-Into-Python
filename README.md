# Properties
  Getters and setters are methods that let us read and write the value of an instance variable of an object.And this is the way we can set and get values rather than directly exposing fields of a class.

  As per the OO Principles, one should have properties as private and changes must be allowed through the   methods only. This rule is for enforcing the guaranty that there will be no accidental change of property. 
  Getters and setters encapsulate the fields of a class by making them accessible only through its public methods and keep the values themselves private. That is considered a good OO principle. ... Getter and setter method are used to get and set the value of x which is the way to achive encapsulation
